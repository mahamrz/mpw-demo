## What is sampled music?

This week introduces the musical, technical, and legal aspects of sampling. Students will learn how to capture, edit, and creatively transform audio into playable instruments and textures, and will complete a short sampling project.

```{admonition} Question
:class: question
Have you ever heard a song sampled in another song? Identify one example and explain how the sample was used.
```

# Learning objectives

- **Explain** the history and cultural role of sampling in modern music.
- **Describe** essential technical concepts (sample rate, bit depth, Nyquist, aliasing).
- **Create** a playable sampler instrument from recorded or sourced audio.
- **Apply** at least three different sampling/processing techniques (chopping, granular synthesis, resampling) in a short composition.
- **Evaluate** ethical and legal issues around sample clearance and attribution.

## Background
Sampling began as tape-edit and turntable techniques and matured with digital samplers in the 1980s. It is now a fundamental creative tool across genres (hip-hop, electronic, experimental, pop). In this course we treat sampling both as a technical skill and a compositional practice.

## Tech fundamentals

#### Sample rate & bit depth
- **Sample rate** determines the highest representable frequency (Nyquist = half the sample rate). Use 44.1 kHz or 48 kHz depending on project requirements.
- **Bit depth** affects dynamic range and noise floor. 16-bit is standard for final distribution; 24-bit is recommended for recording and production stages.

#### Nyquist, aliasing & anti-aliasing
- Frequencies above Nyquist fold back (“alias”) and cause unwanted artifacts. Use proper anti-aliasing filters when downsampling.

#### Resampling, time-stretch & pitch-shift
- **Resampling** changes the playback rate (affects pitch and duration).
- **Time-stretch** algorithms allow tempo changes without pitch change (and vice versa for pitch-shifters), each with trade-offs in quality and artifacts.

## Sampling techniques
- **Loop-based**: take grooves or melodic loops and process them (EQ, compression, transient shaping).
- **Chopping / slicing**: slice an audio file into hits or motifs and re-arrange (common in hip-hop and beat production).
- **Granular sampling**: use small grains to create pads, textures, or micro-rhythms.
- **Layering**: combine multiple samples to create richer timbres (e.g., layered kicks or melodic stacks).
- **Field recording**: capture environmental sounds and make them musical.

---

## In-class demos:
1. **Demo 1 — Create a sampler instrument**:
   - Import a sample (drum hit, vocal phrase, or field recording).
   - Trim, set loop points, and normalize.
   - Map to keyboard range, set ADSR envelope, add filter & LFO.
   - Play melodic/ambient phrases using the sampler.

2. **Demo 2 — Chop a loop to MIDI**:
   - Warp the loop to project tempo, slice into transients (or fixed slices).
   - Convert slices to a sampler or MIDI notes and re-sequence.

3. **Demo 3 — Granular texture from a vocal**:
   - Load a vocal sample into a granular device; adjust grain size and density to make an evolving pad.

# Lab work
1. **Lab 2A — Sample-based loop**
   - Deliverable: 8–16 bar loop using at least two samples (one must be recorded or clearly licensed).
   - Requirements: process samples creatively, include a short README describing sources and techniques.

2. **Lab 2B — Sampler instrument**
   - Deliverable: a playable sampler patch created from a single recorded sound and a short performance audio (30–60 seconds).
   - Requirements: demonstrate mapping, envelope shaping, and at least one creative modulation.

3. **Reflection & citation**
   - Deliverable: 200–300 word reflection describing source choices and legal/ethical considerations; include citations (public domain, CC license, or clearance status).

---

## Legal & ethical considerations
- **Clearance:** In public releases, samples often need clearance from original rights holders. Classroom projects may use samples for educational purposes, but students must document sources and licenses.
- **Creative alternatives:** Use CC0/CC-BY samples (e.g., freesound.org with appropriate license), record your own material, or use commercially cleared sample libraries to avoid legal issues.
- **Attribution:** When required by license, include composer/source credits in your README and project metadata.

---

## Recommended resources
- Freesound.org — free sound library (check individual licenses).
- Ableton Sampling Tutorials, Logic Quick Sampler docs, and other DAW vendor resources.
- Articles and tutorials on time-stretch algorithms, granular synthesis, and resampling best practices.

---

## Advanced topics

- Resynthesis & spectral processing: extract timbres and re-synthesize

---

# Task before next week
<u>Assignment 1</u>

Create a 2-minute stereo mix in WAV that features different sampling techniques.

Deliverables:
- **Audio** file (WAV)  
- **Reflection** (200–300 words): list sample sources, sample licenses, and your reflection.
